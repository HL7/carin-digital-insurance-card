### Use Case - Support for Multiple Digital insurance Cards

A mobile Wallet can contain multiple credit cards or travel passes. The same should be the case for Digital Insurance Cards. 

A consumer should be able to add a digital insurance card to their mobile phone, or create a static printed version of the card by following the approaches identified in the distribution section of this IG. Here are some example scenarios and the approach to be followed:

- A consumer has multiple insurances with different payers.
    - The member would connect to the appropriate payer and retrieve their card.
- A consumer has multiple insurances with the same payer(e.g. Medical, Dental and Vision). 
    - If the plans are not consolidated into a single coverage the member would download the appropriate card for each coverage. 
- A consumer is acting as a personal representative. (e.g. for a child or a parent)
    - The consumer would use a personal representative process, for example when connecting to a member portal to identify that they are acting on behalf of a member, other than themselves. The consumer would then download the card for the person they are representing. 
- A consumer switches plans
    - When a Consumer switches plans their previous card should still be available with the minimum of information that would be found on a traditional insurance card. This will make transition between plans easier if the member can provide the information from their prior plan to their new plan in order to enable transfer of their longitudinal record via payer-to-payer exchange. Just like an expired flight ticket, the consumer should be the one taking action to remove the card from their wallet.
