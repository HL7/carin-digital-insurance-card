### Guidance on Displaying RxIIN (formerly RxBIN) on Digital Insurance Cards
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has transitioned the Issuer Identification Number (IIN), formerly known as the Bank Identification Number (BIN), from a **six-digit** to an **eight-digit** format in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812-1. This change is being adopted across the pharmacy ecosystem, including in the NCPDP Telecommunication Standard Version F6 © and the Pharmacy/Combination ID Card Standard Version 7.1 ©.
