### Use Case - Summary of Benefits and Coverage

The [Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC)](https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/resources/forms-reports-other#Summary_of_Benefits_and_Coverage_and_Uniform_Glossary) is a legally required document under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that serves as a standardized, easy-to-understand summary of what a health insurance plan covers and what costs a patient may incur. The SBC breaks down complex insurance terms and coverage details into a clear format, helping patients understand what services are included, what’s excluded, and how much they might pay for common medical scenarios. By providing consistent information across all plans, the SBC empowers patients to make choices based on their health needs and financial situation. It helps them evaluate trade-offs between premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coverage levels.
